ISSUES/COMPATIBILITIES:
=======================
Some addons may reset the map to gather location data.
If your map continuously jumps back to your current location when selecting another map,
it will be due to another addon resetting it. In most cases the authors have made changes
to correct this so, download the latest version of any conflicting addon.
